Start points:

- Poll SPY data
- Graph polled data
- Apply logistic regression and graph import
- Generate and/or Poll if available, basic indicators.
- React basic site to display data

----
Generate different datasets with different window sizes. We will try to predict only the average of the coming week
The window size will directly imply the size of the input layer
We dont want to run the model prediction on every request, lets store this data in a db.
